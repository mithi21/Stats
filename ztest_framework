Correct Answer: p-value = 0.18, and hence people from the state are not shorter

Explanation:

# Null Hypothesis (H0): People from the person's state are not shorter than the national average height. (i.e.,μ = 65)
# Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): People from the person's state are shorter than the national average height. (i.e.,μ < 65)

import scipy.stats as stats

# Population parameters
population_mean = 65  # Population average height
population_stddev = 2.5  # Population standard deviation

# Sample statistics
sample_mean = 64.5  
sample_size = 20 # Average of 20 people

# Calculate the standard error of the sample mean
standard_error = population_stddev / (sample_size ** 0.5)

# Calculate the Z-score
z_score = (sample_mean - population_mean) / standard_error

# Calculate the p-value: Left Tail Test
p_value = stats.norm.cdf(z_score)

# Significance level
alpha = 0.05

# Compare p-value with the significance level
if p_value < alpha:
    print(f"Reject the null hypothesis. People from the state are shorter.")
else:
    print(f"Fail to reject the null hypothesis. No significant evidence that people from the state are shorter.")

print(f"Z-score: {z_score}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value}")
